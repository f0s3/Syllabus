# Syllabus

Usefull app that allows you to have a look on what lessons you have in a specific day of week or an array of days.

## About

This application is designed for one specific university(i wasn't told to do it and nobody paid me for this).
It gives you great opportunity to see what is the syllabus for any day you want.

## Contacts

If you have any questions, suggestions or ideas, those are welcome to go on my 
e-mail:chnu.syllabus@gmail.com.
If you want me to add a group, then write "NNI or Faculty:Group:name of group" in the theme of that message, information about group needs to be represented as following:

Example:
* NNIIM:D:711. - Theme.
* Monday: #1.subject name. cabinet:301. #2.subject name. cabinet:245.
* Tuesday: #1.subject name. cabinet:159...
etc.
Also it is acceptable if you use MS Excel(or LibreOffice Calc), MS Word(or LibreOffice Writer), etc.
I don't really care about format, but the more nice it is, the better it is for me.
